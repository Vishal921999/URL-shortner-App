# Url Shortner App

This URL Shortener App is a modern web application designed to generate shortened URLs for longer web addresses, making them easier to share and manage. Users can input a long URL, and the application will return a shorter version that redirects to the original URL. Additionally, users can view all their shortened URLs, copy them to the clipboard, or delete them when they are no longer needed. This app leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to provide a robust and scalable solution.
